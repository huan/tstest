tstest is a mature full-featured TypeScript testing tool that helps you write better programs.

The tstest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

## Features

1. Detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert* names);
1. Auto-discovery of test modules and functions;
1. Modular fixtures for managing small or parametrized long-lived test resources;
1. Can run unittest (including trial) and nose test suites out of the box;
1. JavaScript, TypeScript, Google Apps Script (untested);
1. Rich plugin architecture, with over n+ external plugins and thriving community;
1. Out-of-the-Box Dual Browser/Node.js environment testing support;
# SEE ALSO

This module is highly inspired by [pytest](https://pytest.org/)

Thanks to David Auffret who owned the `tstest` name of NPM module. He is so kind and nice that passed this name over to me with the help of support from NPM after my request.
